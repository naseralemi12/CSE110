When I first started coding, the first code statement I learned was:<br/>
```cout << "hello world" << endl;```

**The meme above shows a few characteristics about me**
- I am funny
- My sense of humor is a bit high level
- I have a love and hate relationship with my profession



**I like to do the following things when i start coding**
1. Prepare the ide
2. open the browser for potential lookups
3. read the program requirements carefully
   - if its open ended assignment and there are no special requirements, I brainstorm a little
     - its very important to come up with something  that has the least time complexity
   - but if there are specifications then I make myself understand of all the specs
4. come up with an algorithm and approach.
5. start coding
